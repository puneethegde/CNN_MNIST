## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental computer vision task where the goal is to categorize images into predefined classes or labels. In this project, we use PyTorch to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- PyTorch (>= 1.0)
- torchvision
- matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```shell
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
```

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/puneethegde/CNN_MNIST.git
```
Prepare the dataset: The MNIST dataset will be automatically downloaded during the first run. The data will be stored locally.

## Usage
Go to the .ipynb file and run all the cells

## Training
Once you run the train cell it will take some time, you adjst the parameters and number of epochs if you want

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model on test set here I got 98% of accuracy

## Results
